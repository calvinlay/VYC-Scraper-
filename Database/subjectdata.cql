We explore the key ideas that underpin Australias legal institutions including democracy, sovereignty, the rule of law and the separation of powers. We combine our understanding of the historical development of Australian law and legal institutions with a critical analysis of their conceptual underpinnings using critical legal theory. This theory scrutinises the assumptions, logic, language and practice of law. Using a critical analysis of law, for example, from the perspective of the colonised rather than the colonising, allows students to ask different questions about not only the abstract principles of law, but also the lived experience of law. The subject also introduces students to the nature of legal thinking and legal practice including research methods, and the techniques and principles involved in reading and interpreting case law and statute. Legal reasoning is one of the most important topics in the subject and students are given the opportunity to explore both traditional methods of legal reasoning and critical lenses through which to analyse and evaluate a legal question.

This subject is dedicated to making sense of these complex realities of transnational interrelations and multi-scale governance. We will work with interdisciplinary approaches to examine how distinct and integrated governing regimes, in multiple countries, seek to remediate pressing global issues, especially climate change, water resources, migration, and economic inequality.
